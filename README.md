My script calculates the rain runoff for a 1000 sq. foot plot of land in Kenya using mathematical operators and variables. While working on this lab the original answer I found seemed off, so I did some research into the process of mathematically calculating water runoff to see if my method was correct. This article on Sciencing was useful: https://sciencing.com/calculate-surface-runoff-6505227.html
I also received some very helpful comments (on the conversions and how to round the amount in gallons) from Aaron Deibele, software developer.
